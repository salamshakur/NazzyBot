Meet NazzyBot!

Named after me (Nazeem), Nazzy is my personal Discord bot that I've created using the Node.JS language and the Discord.JS module. He is still a work in progress, as this is just a personal project I've created to get familiar with Node.JS and to bring about a fun new toy in our Discord servers to enjoy! I hope that you take the time to get to know him and watch me as I fine-tune him to be a wonderful addition to any server!

This is an open-source project, so any help from the community would be most appreciated.

Below are all of Nazzy's current commands:

* !hello          - Say hello and Nazzy will say hello back, try it!

* !send cats      - Nazzy will send a random picture or GIF of a cat!

* !send dogs      - Nazzy will send a random picture or GIF of a dog!

* !send (search)  - If cats and dogs isn't your thing, that's ok! Nazzy can send you anything you ask for, try it out!

* !urb            - Give it a word and Nazzy will search Urban Dictionary for it!

* !role (@member) - Tag a member using role to see what permissions they have!

Below are some explanations regarding other files:

* index.js - This file is the main driver and it's what's used initialized Nazzy, to connect it, run it's commands, and check for it's token code.

* Commands - This folder holds all of Nazzy's commands, each are a JavaScript file

* NOTE: To get Nazzy to work, you will need a config.json file that holds the prefix and token of your bot.
